Nanosound plugin structure

| Folder  |Details|
|---------|-------|
| plugins |Contains the files to be copied into the plugins folder in dyn/data/plugins; stored in a folder by type of plugin and then the name|
| nanosound_oled |Contains the files which are copied into dyn/home/volumio; this should not be used anymore!!!|

nanosound_forv3.zip contains all the files required for Nanosound 2.0.0 for Volumio 3.  I only need the OLED code, not the rest (LIRC) and so this needs to be rationalised.

See MPD_OLED for example.  Trying to write bash script to do something similar!
